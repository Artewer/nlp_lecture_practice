# NLP Techniques Implementation

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks implementing basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques from scratch. These notebooks are designed to help understand various NLP concepts by coding them in Python.

## Description

Each notebook in this repository focuses on a different NLP technique, providing both the theoretical background necessary to understand the method and the Python code that implements it. This is meant to aid learning and understanding of fundamental NLP principles and algorithms.

## Contents

- `arithmetic_underflow.ipynb` - Explores the issue of arithmetic underflow in computations and presents techniques to handle it.
- `byte_pair_encoding.ipynb` - Implements Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a popular compression algorithm that has been adapted for subword tokenization in NLP.
- `hmm_pos_tagging.ipynb` - Demonstrates Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMM).
- `naive_bayes.ipynb` - Implements the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification.
- `perplexity.ipynb` - Explains and calculates the perplexity measure for evaluating language models.
- `rnn_forward.ipynb` - Illustrates the forward pass of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed for sequence data.
